<h1>Implementation of packet sniffing and spoofing in software</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Two key ideas in network security are packet sniffing and spoofing, which pose serious risks to network communication. Understanding these two risks is necessary in order to comprehend networking security protocols. Numerous tools exist for packet sniffing and spoofing, including Wireshark, Tcpdump, Netwox, Scapy, and others. Both attackers and security specialists frequently utilize some of these techniques. While knowing how to use these tools is vital, understanding how they operateâ€”that is, how software implements packet sniffing and spoofing.
